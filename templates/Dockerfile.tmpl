# Licenses
# TODO: Uncomment and customize the COPY command below
# Including license files is essential for legal compliance and transparency.
# It ensures proper attribution to original authors, fulfills open source license
# requirements, and enables automated compliance scanning tools to verify licensing.
# COPY --from=builder /usr/share/doc/{{ $packageName }}/copyright /licenses/{{ $packageName }}/

# Libraries
# TODO: Uncomment and customize the COPY command below
# Include the extension's shared objects and related dependencies under the /lib directory.
# CNPG will configure PostgreSQL to locate these libraries at runtime by configuring
# the "dynamic_library_path" GUC to include this path.
# For more details, see: https://cloudnative-pg.io/docs/current/imagevolume_extensions#how-it-works
# COPY --from=builder /usr/lib/postgresql/${PG_MAJOR}/lib/{{ .Name }}* /lib/

# Share
# TODO: Uncomment and customize the COPY command below
# Include the extension's SQL scripts and control files under the /share/extension directory.
# CNPG will configure PostgreSQL to include this path via the "extension_control_path" GUC to
# seamlessly find and manage the current extension.
# For more details, see: https://cloudnative-pg.io/docs/current/imagevolume_extensions#how-it-works
# COPY --from=builder /usr/share/postgresql/${PG_MAJOR}/extension/{{ .Name }}* /share/extension/
